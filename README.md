# Assembly-Codes
This repository will contain basic input, output, and loop operations using assembly coding
The util.asm is used to reduce the assembly coding because this repository is not made for assembly code development rather made for Reverse Engineering


You can checkout the "util.asm" from its origin github page ---> https://github.com/mjbrusso/util.asm.git
